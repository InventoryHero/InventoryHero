# InventoryHero

InventoryHero started as an university project for the course "Mobile Applications" at TU Graz. The basic idea was to provide a simple and easy to use inventorying system for home users. It should be easy to use and simplistic in it's design. 

Though after the course ended we noticed a few things off with the initial draft of the app and I started working on it alone besides univeristy and other projects. Staying true to the origins of InventoryHero the frontend is developed in Vue.js (which I started learning with this project) and Python is used for the backend (where I am also still learning and experimenting with this project). 

## Setup 

I am planning to release the docker image into the wild at some point in time, but for now this repo needs to be forked and the image build with the following docker compose (which can also be found in the base of this repository).

This is the minimal docker compose needed for InventoryHero to work. WIth this configuration in memory sqlite database will be used, so it should be good for giving InventoryHero a try.

```
version: "3.4"
services:
  inventoryhero:
    container_name: inventory-hero
    image: inventoryhero
    build:
      target: release
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```

The following environment variables are available to configure InventoryHero to your needs. For example database configurations please see [Database](#database)
